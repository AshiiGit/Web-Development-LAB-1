        Most pages on the web today were built using HTML4. 
        Although much improved since the first version of HTML written in 1993,
         HTML4 still had its limitations.
         It’s biggest was if web developers or designers wanted to add content or 
         features to their site that weren’t supported in HTML. 
         In that case, they would have to use non-standard proprietary technologies,
          like Adobe Flash, which required users to install browser plugins.
           Even then, some users wouldn’t be able to access that content or feature.
            Users on iPhones and iPads, for example, wouldn’t be able to since those devices don't support Flash.

    <p style="text-align: right;">
        Cue, HTML5. HTML5 was designed to cut out the need for those non-standard proprietary technologies. 
        With this new version of HTML, you can create web applications that work offline, support high-definition video and animations, 
        and know where you are geographically located.
